# drupal-module-onboard

Drupal module for displaying information from [OnBoard](https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/OnBoard) about boards and commissions.

For example, legislation for our City Council is tracked and pulled from OnBoard here:

Current membership lists for our [boards and commissions](https://bloomington.in.gov/boards) are pulled from OnBoard and rendered on the corresponding drupal page:
